We agree to use the following implementation of the market as the interface.

The current on that is:

from tribler/Tribler/community/market/community.py

# Create a bid.
def create_bid(self, price, quantity, timeout):
        """
        Create a bid order (buy order)
        :param price: The price for the order in Bitcoin
        :param quantity: The quantity of the order in MultiChain
        :param timeout: The timeout of the order in seconds, when does the order need to be timed out
        :type price: float
        :type quantity: float
        :type timeout: float
        """

# Create an ask.
def create_ask(self, price, quantity, timeout):
        """
        Create an ask order (sell order)
        :param price: The price for the order in Bitcoin
        :param quantity: The quantity of the order in MultiChain
        :param timeout: The timeout of the order in seconds, when does the order need to be timed out
        :type price: float
        :type quantity: float
        :type timeout: float

These two functions don't give anything as output, neither information nor errors.
The above code works under the assumption that electrum is properly installed and configured on the machine that calls these functions.
