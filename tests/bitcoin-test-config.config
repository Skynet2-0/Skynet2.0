## JSON-RPC options (for controlling a running bitcoin-qt/bitcoind process)

# server=1 tells Bitcoin to accept JSON-RPC commands.
server=1

# You must set rpcuser and rpcpassword to secure the JSON-RPC api
# You should create your own new random password.
# The username and password MUST NOT be the same.

rpcuser=bitcoinrpc
#random password
rpcpassword=7jaikjSDhks8921$@skAsf12893!!2stdikchjkEsFylSOd;32/sdkcl

# How many seconds bitcoin will wait for a complete RPC HTTP request
# after the HTTP connection is established.
rpctimeout=30

# By default, only RPC connections from localhost are allowed. Specify
# as many rpcallowip= settings as you like to allow connections from
# other hosts (and you may use * as a wildcard character):
#rpcallowip=10.1.1.*
#rpcallowip=192.168.1.*

# Listen for RPC connections on this TCP port:
#rpcport=8332

# You can use bitcoind to send commands to bitcoin-qt/bitcoind
# running on another host using this option:
rpcconnect=127.0.0.1

# Use Secure Sockets Layer (also known as TLS or HTTPS) to communicate
# with Bitcoin -server or bitcoind
#rpcssl=1

# OpenSSL settings used when rpcssl=1
rpcsslciphers=TLSv1+HIGH:!SSLv2:!aNULL:!eNULL:!AH:!3DES:@STRENGTH

## Network-related settings:

# Run on the test network instead of the real bitcoin network.
testnet=1

# Connect via a socks proxy
#proxy=127.0.0.1:9050

# Select the version of socks proxy to use (4-5, default: 5)
#socks=5

# Use proxy to reach tor hidden services (default: same as -proxy)

## Quick Primer on addnode vs connect ##
## Let's say for instance you use addnode=4.2.2.4 ##
## addnode will connect you to and tell you about the ##
## nodes connected to 4.2.2.4. In addition it will tell##
## the other nodes connected to it that you exist so ##
## they can connect to you. ##
## connect will not do the above when you 'connect' to it.##
## It will *only* connect you to 4.2.2.4 and no one else.##
## ##
## So if you're behind a firewall, or have other problems ##
## finding nodes, add some using 'addnode'. ##
## ##
## If you want to stay private, use 'connect' to only ##
## connect to "trusted" nodes. ##
## ##
## If you run multiple nodes on a LAN, there's no need for##
## all of them to open lots of connections. Instead ##
## 'connect' them all to one node that is port forwarded ##
## and has lots of connections. ##
## Thanks goes to [Noodle] on Freenode. ##
