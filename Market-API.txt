We agree to use the current implementation of the market as the interface.

The current on that is:

# Create a bid.
def create_bid(self, price, quantity, timeout):
        """
        Create a bid order (buy order)
        :param price: The price for the order
        :param quantity: The quantity of the order
        :param timeout: The timeout of the order, when does the order need to be timed out
        :type price: float
        :type quantity: float
        :type timeout: float
        """

# Create an ask.
def create_ask(self, price, quantity, timeout):
        """

        :param price: The price for the order
